Vue의 컴포넌트 생성주기를 속성으로 간단하게 정리해본다.

## beforeCreate

- data/prop/computed is defined on this stage
- Tips
  - computed
    - don't use arrow function in computed function, that could provide wrong `this` context!

## created

- can access `data/event/computed/props`
- Even if you define `created function` as async function and use await keyword,\
   `mounted function` wouldn't be delayed. these would be processed parallel.

## beforeMount

## mounted

- fetch data
- can access dom
- if you want know when rendering with fetching data is completed by using nextTick on this stage

```js
 mounted () {
     await fetchData();
     this.$nextTick(() => { console.log('rendering was completed with data fetched'); });
 }
```

## \[beforeUpdate\]

- when only data is changed before re-rendering

## \[updated\]

- re-rendering with changed data
- the way to know time when rendering is completed is same as doing on mounted stage

```js
updated () {
     await fetchData();
     this.$nextTick(() => { console.log('rendering was completed with data fetched'); });
 }
```

## beforeDestroy

## destroyed
